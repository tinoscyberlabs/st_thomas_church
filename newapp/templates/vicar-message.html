																<p>I am extremely glad that we are bringing out a new parish directory thisyear after a gap of six years, the first one after our church had been declared as a Forane church on 07.11.2021.  Jesus told us: “I am the vine,you are the branches. Those who abide in me and I in them bear much fruit, because apart from me you can do nothing” (Jn 15:5).  This Bible verse emphasizes that we need to be united with Christ to bear fruit as part of   His own body.
																	The meaningful existence ofa parish community depends on how the members are knit together and live in communion and fellowship as members of a big family. The members of this parish are connected to each other through God who calls us to be together.Every member of this parish is called to become a beacon of hope as we proclaim the Gospel of Jesus Christ and make the kingdom of God a reality in our living context.  The diocese of Mandya has declared this year as the year of care and I hope that by caring for the marginalised and the needy, we become witnesses of God’s compassionate love to the people around us.
																	To ensure the active participation of the parishioners in all the activities of the parish, they should know each other and be connected as well. As ours is a parish with 650 families and 16 wards, I do believe that this photo directory will help the parishioners to know each other and strengthen their bond as members of an extended family.
																	I remember with gratitude, the former vicars, assistant vicars, sisters of D.M convent, trustees, parish council members and heads of piousassociations and all those who played an important rolein shaping this parish and bringing it to the present status. I thank in a very special way the members of the editorial board who worked tirelessly in bringing out this beautifuldirectory.
																	This parish directory does not intend to replace the parish register. I invite you to use this directory responsibly, not only as a source of information about the families of the parish but also to foster communion and fellowship among the members of the parish. Becoming close to the Lord also necessarily implies that we become close to one another. May the Risen Lord lead us into that communion for which he prays in his farewell discourse!
