            <h1>&nbsp;</h1><p style="text-align:justify;">The Catechism School was instituted to impart spiritual formation and catechetical training, primarily to the children of the parish. However, the school is open to all interested catholic children irrespective of their parish affiliations. Children from other parishes can also attend the Sunday school classes provided they present a recommendation from their parish priests.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">The Sunday school has grown over the years, in quality and student strength, and the active involvement of parishioners. Classes are held from standard I to X, with extra divisions for classes that have higher strength. Present strength of the School is over 380 students and all the teachers are qualified and good in training the students and offer their services for this noble cause.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify;">A separate Holy mass is celebrated every Sunday for catechism children to make them more participative in the liturgy and prayers. Teachers are given training to make their role more fruitful. Childrenâ€™s choir is also functioning where interested children are given practice in singing and music. Training in vocal and instrumental music is given to them.</p><figure class="table"><strong><p style="text-align:center;"></p></table></figure>
